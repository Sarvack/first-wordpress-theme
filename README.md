# wordpress-theme-one
first theme, will make another theme soon

I used typed.min.js on this project when I trying to upload something appear and I don't know how to solve yet, so the file typed.min.js can't upload

On vendor directory create new folder and name it typed

On "typed" folder create new file and name it typed.min.js
